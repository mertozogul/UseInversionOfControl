# Inversion Of Control
Ioc Principle, Dependency Inversion Principle, Ioc With Dependency Injection, DI With Unity Container

We want to make loosely coupled design with any project which is developed with any language. 


The terms Inversion of Control (IoC), Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), Dependency Injection (DI), and IoC containers may be familiar.

We cannot achieve loosely coupled classes by using IoC alone. Along with IoC, we also need to use DIP, DI and IoC container. The following figure illustrates how we are going to achieve loosely coupled design step by step in the next few chapters.
